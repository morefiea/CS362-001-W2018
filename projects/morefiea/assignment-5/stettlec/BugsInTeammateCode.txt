Detected Bugs:

1.  Appt.java: Line 92:
    "this.startMinute = startHour;"
	Start minute is being set to StartHour in the constructor for appointment.
	
2.  Appt.java: Line 123:
    ""
	Else was deleted, meaning the other conditionals in getValid are run even if one of them failed.
	In many cases valid will be set to true even if it's not.
	
3.	Appt.java: Line 227:
	"if (recurDays != null) {"
	The first conditional in RecurDays has been negated, so it will ignore the argument if its not null and evaluate it if it is.
	This results in null pointer errors, as well as the functionality obviously being lost.
	
4.	TimeTable.java: Line 52:
	"for (int i = 0; i < appts.size(); i=i) {"
	Rather than incrementing i, it's just getting set to itself every iteration.
	This is causing an infinite loop.
